Fibonacci (fib.asm)
This program should read in an integer and print the corresponding Fibonacci number.

Your program should use the naive recursion strategy (a fib function that calls itself twice).

The Fibonacci function is defined as:
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(x) = fib(x-1) + fib(x-2) when x > 1
